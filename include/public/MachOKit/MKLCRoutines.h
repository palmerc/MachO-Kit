//! The routines command contains the address of the dynamic shared library
//! initialization routine and an index into the module table for the module
//! that defines the routine.  Before any modules are used from the library
//! the dynamic linker fully binds the module that defines the initialization
//! routine and then calls it.  This gets called before any module
//! initialization routines (used for C++ static constructors) in the library.
