//!
//! @section sec_intro Introduction
//! libMachO is a lightweight, C library for parsing Mach-O binaries. To keep
//! the library lightweight libMachO overlays itself atop the MachO binary and
//! provides a structured set of APIs to parse the data. libMachO does not
//! build up its own independent representation of the Mach-O opting to
//! continuously walk the Mach-O structures to access requested data.  This
//! means that libMachO generally expects well-formed MachO binaries.
//!
//! Differences between the target architecture of the Mach-O binary and your
//! process are handled by libMachO.  Access to data of the Mach-O binary is
//! abstracted by a memory map and one or more memory objects vended by the
//! map.  libMachO includes memory maps for accessing MachO binaries loaded
//! into the current process, or another process for which your process has
//! rights to the task port.  Memory access through a memory map is checked to
//! ensure invalid memory cannot be accidentally accessed, in the case of a
//! malformed Mach-O binary.
//!
//! libMachO does not perform any dynamic memory allocation.  Clients are
//! responsible for allocating buffers which are then initialized by the
//! various parsers in libMachO.  Consequently, the lifetimes of these buffers
//! must be managed by clients.
